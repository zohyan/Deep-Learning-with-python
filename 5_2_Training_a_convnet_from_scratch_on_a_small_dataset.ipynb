    "Having to train an image-classification model using very little data is a common situation, which you’ll likely encounter in practice if you ever do computer vision in a professional context. __A “few” samples can mean anywhere from a few hundred to a\n",
    "few tens of thousands of images__. As a practical example, we’ll focus on classifying images as dogs or cats, in a dataset containing 4,000 pictures of cats and dogs (2,000 cats, 2,000 dogs). We’ll use 2,000 pictures for training—1,000 for validation, and 1,000 for testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we’ll review one basic strategy to tackle this problem: training a new model from scratch using what little data you have. You’ll start by naively training a small convnet on the 2,000 training samples, without any regularization, to set a baseline for what can be achieved. This will get you to a classification accuracy of 71%. At that point, the main issue will be overfitting. Then we’ll introduce __data augmentation__, a __powerful technique for mitigating overfitting in computer vision__. By using data augmentation, you’ll improve the network to reach an accuracy of 82%.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next section, we’ll review __two more essential techniques__ for applying deep learning to small datasets: __feature extraction with a pretrained network__ (which will get you to an accuracy of 90% to 96%) and __fine-tuning a pretrained network (this will get you to a final accuracy of 97%)__. Together, these __three strategies__—training a small model from scratch, doing feature extraction using a pretrained model, and fine-tuning a pretrained model—will constitute your future __toolbox for tackling the problem of performing image classification with small datasets__."

    "You’ll sometimes hear that deep learning only works when lots of data is available. This is valid in part: one fundamental __characteristic of deep learning__ is that it can __find interesting features in the training data on its own__, without any need for manual feature engineering, and this can only be achieved when lots of training examples are available. This is __especially true for problems where the input samples are very highdimensional, like images__.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what __constitutes lots of samples is relative__—__relative to the size and depth of the network you’re trying to train__, for starters. It isn’t possible to train a convnet to solve a complex problem with just a few tens of samples, but a few hundred can potentially suffice if the model is small and well regularized and the task is simple. Because convnets learn local, translation-invariant features, they’re highly data efficient on perceptual problems. Training a convnet from scratch on a very small image dataset will still yield reasonable results despite a relative lack of data, without the need for any custom\n",
    "feature engineering. You’ll see this in action in this section.\n",

Specifically, in the case of computer vision, many pretrained models (usually trained on the Image-Net dataset) are now publicly available for download and can be used to bootstrap powerful vision models out of very little data. That’s what you’ll do in the next section. Let’s start by getting your hands on the data."
